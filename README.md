Whatsapp Web Clone uses a number of open source projects and other services to work properly:

* VueJs - Vue.js is a progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web.
* Vuex - Centralized State Management for Vue.js.
* TypeScript - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.
* Vuetify - Material Component Framework for Vue
* Cloud Firestore - Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database that lets you easily store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps - at global scale.
